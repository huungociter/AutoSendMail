# Project Setup Guide
## 1. Create the ".env" File
 After compiling your application, locate the directory of your compiled file (e.g., bin/Debug/net8.0/ or bin/Release/net8.0/). Create a `.env` file here if it doesn't exist.

## 2. Add Environment Variables
 Copy the environment variables from `.env.example` into the `.env` file and fill in the necessary values.

## 3. Moving the "List Send Mail For PIC.xlsx"
 Move the `List Send Mail For PIC.xlsx` file in the same directory. Add the emails you need to send when running the application.
